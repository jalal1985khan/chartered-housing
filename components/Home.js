<p className="fs-55">Is a journey of building homes that spans three decades, only about building homes? When we first laid the foundation stone for Chartered Housing in 1989, little did we realize the significance of our journey! From a company that started building <a href="https://www.charteredhousing.com/luxury-villas-in-bangalore/">villas</a>, <a href="https://www.charteredhousing.com/luxury-apartments-in-bangalore/">apartments</a> and <a href="https://www.charteredhousing.com/plot-for-sale-in-bangalore/">plots in Bangalore</a>, to a brand that today adds value to people’s lives, ensures safety and promises reliability through its body of work, we have come a long way. However, what remains unchanged is our unflinching commitment towards offering Quality through Transparency – something we have always believed in and continue to.</p>
<p className="fs-55">A constantly evolving journey, the conviction in our values and the passion to set new benchmarks, has helped us achieve more than what we set out to; build just homes. And be recognized among the top real estate developers in Bangalore.</p>
